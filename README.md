### The Feminist Comic Network is happy to announce its second zine! 
Our bodies have been policed for centuries. Norms of what is socially acceptable and considered beautiful still shame everyone that deviates from them. The targets are mostly women, but men also suffer from these norms. The profiteers are capitalist corporations that propagate and communicate unhealthy standards of what to eat, drink, wear and put onto our skin. It's time we stepped away from that and build a self-loving relationship with our bodies.

***The Body Positivity*** zine will feature stories about how to reconnect to our innate body wisdom so we can have more balanced, joyful self-care, and a relationship with our whole selves that is guided by love, forgiveness, and humor.

These stories could explore:
the intersection of gender identity and body positivity
body positive     pregnancy
favourite food & guilt
physical scars
dis_ability and    beauty
weight, size, body hair
racism and the body
    
...all of these intertwined and more.

We think that nobody should work for free, so accepted submissions will be paid for.

### Submission Guidelines:

Pitches for short comics (max. 4 pages) or illustrations (1 page) that are thematically centered on the main topic of body positivity. Critical stances on the movement and the term are also welcome. The zine will be printed in black and white/greyscale. 

**Topic: "Body Positivity"
Deadline: February 21st, 2018
Specs: 300dpi, A5, b/w, please leave a border, we cannot print borderless
Accepted permissions will be paid 3 € per page.

We are DEFINITELY looking for:

– comics from marginalized artists, your voice matters!    
– both fiction and non-fiction. Feel free to explore the topic directly or indirectly     through any genre that suits you
– stories with an uplifting message. We do not mind hearing about the realistic (and sometimes negative) experiences but our goal is to empower readers

We are NOT looking for:

– stories with any racist bias whatsoever    
– stories that uses intellectual property that does not belong to you (ie, no fancomics)
