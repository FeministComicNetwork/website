Henna is a freelance comic artist, illustrator and cultural manager living in Berlin, Germany.

As a cultural manager Hennas focus is in events and print media – electronic music and visual culture (comics, contemporary art, film festivals). I’m especially experienced in coordination, promotion and bookings and Hennas projects tend to combine politics, art and culture and be non-profit.

Since 2014 Henna is mainly working as a comic artist and illustrator, but is open for projects in cultural management. If you are interested to talk more or collaborate on a project, don’t hesitate to [contact Henna!](cargocollective.com/hennarasanen)
