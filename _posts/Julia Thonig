Julia Thonig is a young German artist living in Berlin. She studies illustration and is a fascinated budgie breeder which is typical for her artwork. Inspired by the forest near the house she grows up, her paintings are very colorful. She has always been in love with nature.

Mostly she draws friendly, charming and sympathetic characters in natural settings and landscapes. Often she uses acrylic and water colors to style the illustrations. Her digital artwork is marked more graphically and simple but also colorful.
