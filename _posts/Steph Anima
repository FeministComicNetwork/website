I'm a Berlin based Illustration Designer and Freelancer.
Studied at AID Berlin until October 2016.

I love to create vector graphics and flat designs, but traditional analog works will never vanish. That's why I developed very different and flexible art styles and don't stick to one especially. Learning new techniques and methods are important to me. Growing never ends.

Graphic Design work in different fields such as Layout Design,
Logo Design, little Animations and also Interface Design belong to my set of skills - for digital or printed media.
