# New Zine Call!
Hello everyone! The Feminist Comic Network wants to create an anthology zine and we would love to receive your applications! <3

The topic is **"quiet riot"**! 

There are a lot of awful things happening in the world right now. We stand in solidarity with all those suffering from conflict, displacement, the consequences of climate change, and the most recent rise of fascist tendencies in many countries around the world. 

In spite of this, we are happy and proud that many people are taking to the streets and take a stand for peace, human rights, nature, the future of their homes, and much more.

You can see a lot more huge protest and loud riots in the media, and we celebrate these great acts of activism.

Those protests and riots are easy to notice, but they aren't the only forms of protests that can bring attention to topics and foster change.

Hello everyone,

it's a new year, and the Feminist Comic Network wants to create another anthology zine. We would love to receive your applications! <3

This time, the theme is "quiet riot"!

There are a lot of awful things happening in the world right now. We stand in solidarity with all those suffering from conflict, displacement, the consequences of climate change, and the most recent rise of fascist tendencies in many countries around the world. 
In spite of this, we are happy and proud that many people are taking to the streets and take a stand for peace, human rights, nature, the future of their homes, and much more.
You can see a lot more huge protest and loud riots in the media, and we celebrate these great acts of activism.
Those protests and riots are easy to notice, but they aren't the only forms of protests that can bring attention to topics and foster change. 
There are also riots that are quiet or slow; protests you need to look twice to see, or think about a little bit before you notice them as a form of activism.
There are organisations and groups that do big, great and important work and also a lot of individuals who do small things with big impact on justice and their communities.

"Quiet Riot" wants to put your attention to these forms of activism. We want to emphasize the importance of often overlooked acts of protest, the daily work some people put into it and the change they are making.

We are curious what your creative minds will create with these words in mind!
Stories can be fictional, historical, or real life experience by you or others.
Your story matters! Your story deserves to be read!
Tell us a story of a quiet riot you did or saw, a quiet riot you want to do or one you wish to exist in this world. 

## Infos:

- submissions, if accepted, will be paid 20 € per page (you dont have to send us drafts or sketches, we usually accept all submissions if they aren't discriminatory or against our manifesto)

- please use CMYK and DIN A5 upright format

- colors are possible but not needed if you don't want to use them

- comics, illustrations and small prose texts (for text max. 1 Din-A4 page - font size 12, preferred in combination with illustrations) are allowed. Comics are preferred (since we are a COMIC Network).

- submissions don't have to be brand new, just not yet published (this rule does not apply to personal social media posts)

- the zine will be in English. If you want to submit other languages, that's possible but you will need to also send us an English translation that can be printed alongside the comic.
- This is gonna be a non-profit zine in a quite small edition. We are going to make the zine, because we just really want to do a zine and we want to give all feminist creators another (little) stage for their amazing art. <3
